- `InnerSum`: naive approach that is faster for small values but needs more keys.
- `ReplicateLog`: optimal log approach that works for any value (not only powers of two) and can be parameterized to replicate batches of values (sub-vectors).
- `Replicate`: naive approach that is faster for small values but needs more keys.

#### New CKKS Encoder methods
- `PtDiagMatrix`: struct that represents a linear transformation.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-02-26
### Added
- BFV/CKKS: Added API for encrypting using a CRP (common reference polynomial).
- BFV/CKKS: Added API for encrypting faster (encrypts zero directly in Q instead of QP and does not need to divide by P).
- BFV/CKKS: Parameters can now be created without the modulus P. Doing so disables all key-switching operations.

- RING: Added benchmarks for a NTT using purely Barrett reduction for comparison purposes.
### Changed 
- BFV/CKKS: Changed the switching keys from (-as1 + (s0-s1) + e, a) to (-as1 + s0 + e, a). This does not affect the user experience as it only changes the internal behavior, which is kept consistent. However, Rotation and KeySwitching keys generated with older releases will induce wrong results and will need to be re-generated.
### Fixes
- BFV: Fixed EncryptFromSK that was not correctly wiping the memory pool before using it, which lead to back encryptions.
- BFV: Fixed an index out of bound error that would happen during the multiplication if #QMul > #Qi.

- CKKS: MulRelin now always returns a fully reduced ciphertext.
- DCKKS: PCKS and CKS now correctly set the scale of the output ciphertext to the scale of the input ciphertext.
- RING: Fixed GenerateNTTPrimes that could return twice the same prime if the initial value was prime.
- RING: The function context.UniformPoly now samples based on the number of moduli of the context rather than based on the input polynomial.

- BFV/CKKS/DBFV/DCKKS: The structures are now created using the parameters instead of the context.
- BFV: Quantization during multiplication does not use Float128 any more, resulting in a substantial speed improvement.
- BFV: BatchEncoder has been renamed Encoder.
- CKKS: The scale is now stored as a float64 instead of a power of 2.
- CKKS: Rounding is applied instead of flooring when a real value is converted to an integer value. This change affects the rescaling and the encoding.
